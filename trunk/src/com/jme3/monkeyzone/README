MonkeyZone Dev Infos (for true monkeys only)

When understanding the terms used during the naming of classes, variables etc.
most of the code should be self-explanatory. Most classes have javadoc descriptions
on what they do, almost all methods have javadoc too.

Terminology:

Player
Logical human or AI player that can enter entities and generally act, uses
ManualControl or AutonomousControl and sends net data when the AI
is run on the client. Only exists as PlayerData "database" with long id.

Entity
Spatial with UserData, a world object like character, vehicle, box or factory.
The base form is defined only by a String pointing to the j3o which already has
all userdata like hitpoints, speed etc.

Group
Group of players that play together (human and AI), for now thats the same as
client_id of human player for all AIControl'd players originating from that client.

Client
Computer connected to server

User
Human player using client
